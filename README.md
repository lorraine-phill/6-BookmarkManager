6-BookmarkManager
=================

Create a bookmark manager (similar to that of pineapple.io or delicious.com) that allows a user to register and login 
to a site that maintains a collection of links, which are organised by tags. The goal of this project was for exposure
to the following aspects of web development:

Integration testing with Capybara
Using test tools Rspec and Cucumber
Relational databases and tools (Postgres, SQL Lite, pgAdmin3, DataMapper) and SQL
Security considerations (password encryption etc.)
The Sinatra platform
